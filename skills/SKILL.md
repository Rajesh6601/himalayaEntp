### Key Documents in the Workflow

| Document | Generated By | When | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| **Purchase Order (PO)** | System (PDF) | Buyer issues PO | Formal commitment to buy at agreed price |
| **Invoice** | Supplier | After production / before dispatch | GST-compliant tax invoice for payment |

| **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)** | Buyer | On receiving goods | Formal acknowledgment of receipt |
| **QC Report** | Buyer | After inspection | Accept/reject with inspection remarks |
| **Payment Receipt** | System | On payment confirmation | Record of advance & balance payments |

### Payment Flow (Implemented)

**Advance Payment (Buyer → Supplier):**
- Triggered when order status is `po_issued`
- Buyer enters advance amount (placeholder suggests 50% of PO value) and optional UTR/transaction reference
- Backend stores amount in `orders.advance_paid` column and transitions status to `advance_paid`
- Role-restricted: only buyers can send `advance_payment` messages

**Balance Payment (Buyer → Supplier):**
- Triggered when order status is `qc_approved` (after goods received and QC passed)
- UI displays: `Advance Paid: ₹X | Balance Due: ₹(Total - Advance)`
- Balance amount auto-calculated: `PO Total Value - Advance Paid`
- Backend stores amount in `orders.balance_paid` column and transitions status to `completed`
- Role-restricted: only buyers can send `balance_payment` messages

**Invoice PDF Payment Display:**
- Invoice PDF shows `Advance Received: ₹X | Balance Due: ₹(Grand Total - Advance Paid)`
- Payment terms displayed from invoice record (default: "50% advance, 50% on delivery after QC")

**Database Columns (orders table):**
- `advance_paid NUMERIC(14,2) DEFAULT 0` — stores advance payment amount
- `balance_paid NUMERIC(14,2) DEFAULT 0` — stores balance payment amount

**Invoice vs PO Validation (Implemented):**
- Server rejects invoice if subtotal exceeds PO value by more than 5% tolerance
- Error message shows exact amounts: invoice subtotal, PO value, and maximum allowed
- 5% tolerance accounts for minor tax/transport adjustments
- Supplier invoice form displays the PO value being invoiced against for transparency

### Payment Terms (Default)
- **50% advance** on PO issuance
- **50% balance** on delivery after QC approval
- Prices inclusive of fabrication; transport extra
- PO valid for 30 days from date of issue
- Disputes subject to Patna jurisdiction

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript (no framework dependencies)
- **Backend** (production): Node.js + Express REST API with JWT authentication
- **Database** (production): PostgreSQL 16 (Dockerized)
- **Data Storage** (demo): localStorage fallback when API is unavailable
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, Node API, Nginx, pgAdmin)
- **Hosting**: Any static hosting for demo; Docker host for production

### Dual-Mode Architecture
The frontend automatically detects whether the backend API is running:
- **API available** (Docker stack running): All data (products, users, orders, favorites, contacts) is stored in PostgreSQL via the REST API.
- **API unavailable** (static hosting / file:// open): Falls back to localStorage for demo/offline usage. No backend required.

This means the same frontend code works in both modes seamlessly.

```bash
cd deployment
docker compose up -d --build
# Frontend: http://localhost:8080
# API:      http://localhost:8080/api/health
# pgAdmin:  http://localhost:5051
```

### Running without Docker (Demo)
Simply open `index.html` in a browser. All data persists in localStorage.

### Seed Data Versioning
The frontend uses `SEED_VERSION` (currently v3) in `catalog.js` to manage localStorage product data. When the seed version is bumped, localStorage is cleared and re-seeded with updated product data including image references.

### Customization
To customize the platform:

1. **Company details**: Edit the HTML files directly to change company name, address, phone, email.
2. **Products**: Modify `deployment/api/db/init.sql` (production) or `seedProducts()` in `js/catalog.js` (demo).
3. **Colors**: Update CSS variables in `:root` section of `css/styles.css`.
4. **Users**: Edit `init.sql` (production) or `seedUsers()` in `js/auth.js` (demo).
5. **API endpoints**: Modify `deployment/api/server.js` to add/change business logic.
6. **Images**: Add new images to `assets/` folder and update product records in both `init.sql` and `catalog.js`.
